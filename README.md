# ABNTomize

The code is inside of Master Branch and I donÂ´t how to fix or move to Main Branch, so just will be like this and I'm avoiding headache.

The mainly funcionality is auto-configuration of documents with the ABNT's standards for academic propouses.

It isn't finished yet, I'm going to use and because I'm a student too and I need to finish my Gradution work.

It's your graduation work? Nope, this just a simple pratice training and give me a little headache.
